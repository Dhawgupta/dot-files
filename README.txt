Hi, These are my dot-files.
The ones you might be interested in are :-
1) Neovim config - ./.config/nvim/
2) Polybar - ./.config/polybar/
3) i3 - ./.config/i3/
4) Polybar - ./.config/polybar
5) urxvt - ./.Xresources

There are others too which you might be interested in, like ./.xinitrc ./.xmodmap (for changing key bindings like swapping caps lock and esc key)
